* Try nodelets
  - Will this speed things up?

* Need to try the process on an actual video stream
  - Need to use it on an actual Kinect
  - Could also take several new pictures and try it on those

* Need to account for orientation noise
  - Pitch and roll will be 0 (i.e. aligned with base_frame.  Only yaw will be different in reality.  Need to do some work to eliminate pitch and roll from SE(3) matrix.

* Can I use fewer template cubes?

Next Steps:
----------
- Run the matching with an ASUS connected
  * Set up a single block and try doing the matching.
  * Keep it running in real-time and print out the results.
  * Try nodelets and see if those will help.
- Test the code on the youBot
  * Run the ROS node on the youBot with the arm in the proper position and print the results.
